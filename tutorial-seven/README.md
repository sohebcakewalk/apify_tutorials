# Quiz

- **Actors have a `Restart on error` option in their Settings. Would you use this for your regular actors? Why? When would you use it, and when not?**
    - Actors with `restart on error` might keep restarting, even though the error might never be resolved, e.g. because INPUT data is invalid or some setting is wrong. Due to the `restart on error` setting, the actor will just keep restarting forever.
    - If our regular actor process is not running longer then we would not use this `Restart on error` option in the actor settings.
    - Usually, We use `Restart on error` option for Long-running actors.
    - For short-running actors we would not use it.
    - Generally, we don't use it ever unless there is no other option.


- **Migrations happen randomly, but by setting `Restart on error` and then throwing an error in the main process, you can force a similar situation. Observe what happens. What changes and what stays the same in a restarted actor run?**
    - Whenever the actor restarts, all the user defined variables will be changed. However it keeps the values of default dataset, default requestQueue and default keyValue pair objects.
    - So it seems like all the APIFY default variables will sustain and other objects will be destroyed.


- **Why don't you usually need to add any special code to handle migrations in normal crawling/scraping? Is there a component that essentially solves this problem for you?**
    - We donâ€™t need to add any special code to handle migrations in normal crawling/scraping because RequestList is auto persisted in Key-Value Store and RequestQueue is long-term storage. Without that, the migrated actor would start from scratch.
    - `Restart on Error` flag solves this problem for us.
    - The crawlers automatically pauses AutoscaledPool and turns off autoscaling, so that no new request will be executed, however it has to wait untill the running task is executed.


- **How can you intercept the migration event? How much time do you need after this takes place and before the actor migrates?**
    - The Apify SDK persists its state automatically, using the **migrating** and **persistState** events. **persistState** notifies SDK components to persist their state at regular intervals in case a migration happens. The **migrating** event is emitted just before a migration.
    - To persist state manually, you can use the Apify.events method in the Apify SDK.

            `Apify.events.on('migrating', () => {
                    Apify.setValue('my-crawling-state', {
                        foo: 'bar',
                    }
                });`


- **When would you persist data to a default key-value store and when would you use a named key-value store?**
    - If we want to persist data indefinitely then we should use named key-value store otherwise default key-value store which expire after 7 days unless otherwise specified.
    - For both `long-running` actors and `short-running` actors we can use any (`default key-value store` OR `named key-value store`). It just depend on retention period.
